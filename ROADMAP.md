# Roadmap

Chordrift will be developed in small, auditable milestones. Neon is the source
of truth throughout, while Spotify and Apple Music remain provider adapters.

The Spotify downloadable history archive is an optional, independently
importable enrichment source. No other milestone is blocked on receiving it.

## Discovery and orchestration model

Chordrift will become the canonical orchestrator of playlists, while song
discovery remains native to each streaming platform. New provider playlists can
act as discovery inboxes: Chordrift ingests their tracks, identifies songs
already represented in the canonical library, and incorporates only the new
material into its analysis. Repeated runs should leave those inbox surfaces
clean and ready for further discovery without losing any tracks.

Existing provider playlists and their names remain intact until Chordrift has
clustered every track into an inspectable proposed structure and the user has
approved the LLM-suggested names and organization. Retiring an old or inbox
playlist must be an explicit, auditable synchronization operation performed
only after all of its tracks are accounted for in approved canonical playlists.

## v0.0.0 — Namespace reservation

Reserve the crate and repository names with a minimal, dependency-free package.

## v0.0.1 — Project skeleton and Storexa

Add configuration, CLI boundaries, Storexa-backed Neon access, migrations, and
the canonical schema. Provide version and database-status commands.

Status: complete.

## v0.0.2 — Spotify read-only inventory

Authenticate with Spotify and snapshot playlists, ordered memberships, saved
tracks, and provider metadata without remote mutations.

Status: complete.

## v0.0.3 — Canonical model and playlist analysis

Normalize tracks into provider-independent identities and report playlist
overlap, duplicate memberships, and library statistics. Add an incremental
Spotify-to-Neon pull that reconciles removals, keeps account identity dynamic,
and refreshes derived state. Persist account-scoped observed, discovery-inbox,
and managed playlist roles plus explicit drift authority, without remote
provider mutations.

Status: complete.

## v0.0.4 — Optional listening-history enrichment

Import Spotify history exports independently, preserve matched and unmatched
events, and derive play-count, duration, recency, and skip statistics. The rest
of Chordrift remains usable before or without this data.

Add a basic read-only query surface for accounts and playlists, ordered songs
within a playlist, canonical analysis, listening-history summaries, and
per-track listening statistics. These commands should make it possible to
verify that Neon is clean and current without writing SQL. Preserve duplicate
entries and expose stable provider IDs whenever a mutable name is ambiguous.

Archive ingestion uses a Git-ignored per-account inbox and collision-safe local
archive. Imports are content-addressed and event-deduplicated so periodic
overlapping exports can be added safely. Raw IP addresses and unrelated account
PII are excluded from the canonical database. Neon remains authoritative; the
unchanged local ZIP archive is a disaster-recovery and future reprocessing
source that can rebuild enrichment without requesting another Spotify export.

Status: complete.

## Deferred provider track — Apple Music

Apple Music is not on the critical path to the canonical library. Its provider
foundation is isolated on the `codex/apple-music` branch until paid Apple
Developer Program access is independently worthwhile and the integration can
be tested with real credentials. When resumed, add MusicKit authorization,
ISRC-first catalog matching with scored metadata fallbacks, unresolved-match
reporting, and optional privacy-export history ingestion. Keep all operations
read-only until the normal synchronization approval milestone.

Spotify and Neon remain sufficient to develop and validate embeddings,
clustering, naming, playlist proposals, and dry-run synchronization. Apple work
will be rebased onto the then-current main line rather than reserving or
blocking a release number.

Neon remains canonical; Spotify is the only active provider and intake surface
until native Apple support resumes. Before clearing an existing Apple Music
library, transfer any Apple-only tracks or playlists into a temporary Spotify
intake, pull them into Neon, and verify canonical coverage. After that one-time
consolidation, SongShift can mirror multiple Chordrift-managed Spotify playlists
to Apple Music using the same approved canonical names. No aggregate "two way
sync" or transfer-relay playlist is required.

Until native Apple matching resumes, Spatial Audio curation uses an explicit
manual workaround:

1. Chordrift or the user creates a dedicated Spotify playlist of candidate
   tracks.
2. The user scans its public Spotify URL with
   [Hello Atmos](https://helloatmos.app/spotify/) to identify Apple Music Dolby
   Atmos matches.
3. The filtered set is exported to a specially named Apple Music Spatial Audio
   playlist directly, or copied into a temporary filtered Spotify playlist and
   mirrored with SongShift.

This third-party result is a convenience, not authoritative Chordrift provider
state. It must not silently populate verified Apple identifiers or Spatial
Audio flags in Neon. A future native adapter will match exact recordings,
retain storefront and evidence provenance, and cache Apple's extended
`audioVariants` value `dolby-atmos` so repeated queries are unnecessary.

## v0.0.5 — Embeddings

Build versioned hybrid representations. Use a pretrained music-audio foundation
model (initially MERT, with MuQ evaluated as an alternative) as the reusable
acoustic base whenever Chordrift has lawful access to locally owned, DRM-free
audio. Add semantic context from explicitly semantic legacy playlists, artist
and album relationships, and historical names. Store behavioral preference and
lifecycle signals—plays, recency, completion, skips, provider-curated rotation,
inbox status, and recommendation provenance—separately so unrelated favorites
do not become acoustically similar merely because both are frequently played.
Spotify-only tracks must retain a deterministic personal/metadata fallback
rather than downloading or scraping provider audio.

## v0.0.6 — Vibe clustering

Create reproducible cluster generations with stable identities,
representatives, statistics, and support for unassigned tracks.

## v0.0.7 — Naming and proposed library

Generate names, descriptions, and semantic tags, then expose a complete,
inspectable, non-destructive proposed playlist structure. Require user approval
of generated names and organization, and prove that every track from each
legacy or discovery playlist is represented before proposing its retirement.

## v0.0.8 — Full dry-run synchronization

Plan idempotent Spotify diffs without mutating the service. Include discovery
inbox ingestion, cross-playlist duplicate removal, and explicit retirement
plans for legacy and consumed inbox playlists, with track-preservation checks
and no implicit deletions. Provider-neutral plan structures must allow Apple
Music diffs and Spatial Audio variants to be added later without changing the
canonical model.

## v0.0.9 — Spotify apply readiness

Validate approval records, operation ordering, interruption recovery,
rate-limit handling, and convergence checks against Spotify fixtures and
read-only probes. Continue to prohibit remote mutations while proving that an
approved plan can be executed safely and audited completely.

## v0.1.0 — Canonical music library

Synchronize approved canonical playlists from Neon to Spotify, retain
provenance and operation history, and converge to zero changes on repeated
runs. Remove legacy or consumed discovery playlists only as separately approved
operations after their replacement playlists are published and verified. Apple
Music publishing and Spatial Audio companions remain a subsequent provider
milestone unless the deferred provider track is completed earlier.
